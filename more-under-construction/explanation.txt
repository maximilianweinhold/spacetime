Obviously a global state exists, right? Can we pretend its invariant for the purposes of the experiment? Where does die unschärferelation come in? 

Twice-orthogonalized (stepout-stepin) recovery? Discretization below? Can spin drop below? Is this all in the application of logic, and thus illogical? 

Could there be a different branch?
