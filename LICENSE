*As an extension on the existing licence and a positionality statement, the author abhors and forbids, under all legal statues granted to novel ideas, the development of these concepts for military industrial capacity, as a far-more antiquated organization than the ideas presented within. The sole exception to this rule is if a peer-supported, to the ideal capacity, notion of 'military industrial capacity' translates a focus to prosocial proecological promotional endeavors, which does not includes strikes on 'undesirable' parties. Wind turbines regard better than widows - polar bears could use seafloats. Any development on physics, as the heritage of all, cannot be used to diminish the capacity for future thought.
