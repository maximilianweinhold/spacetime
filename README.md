A space to at least think before time. A now-having-started starting repo. 

Does an algorithm exist below the Planck time? Survey says maybe! A gift from BHs. 

Can a framed operator algebra on a limited runtime compute molecules? Evidently perhaps. 

If you've got a proof with neutrinos, I'm all ears. 

Before we question spacetime, capitalization added, is the original manuscript. Some things are wrong as I'm trying to presently prove. The star is a fill-in for a mode of operation, which is stated as uncertainty while time. Want to help me (re-)design *tacparcel*?
