Cleverly stated, we('ve) prove nothing. Just a note. I'm working on it, let's chat. 

Idk what - if functionally nothing - goes on under the planck interval, but some signs point the way. 

There exists a great deal of residual heat in space at any given moment. Even un-useful 'waste'. Assuming we are able to use at least some of this to nonsensically shuffle, not requiring energy until a state transition is found, we may create an exploratory space on molecules. Then, if a modicum of conformational energy is left over (dampened), or pre-loaded, into space it seems like it could resemble something else. ON THE SCALES WE'RE INTERESTED IN ONLY MOMENTARILY, since we're dealing with (information theoretic) black holes. At least, as you define it as representing orthogonally to our 'regular' spacetime. 

--> I don't know where any of that came from, bt I do know this:

Somewhere far above are objects. From their ceiling, we'd call them molecules. And somehow, a persistent ordering and flexibility of space enables them to fly and blob and spallate in wonderous ways. Chemistry aside, since you know we can't perturb these <attosecond processes at attosecond scales, I'd **imagine** quite immediately finding Unc(), we *imagine* some notion of energy and some notion of clustering in space. Like a stress-energy tensor. But I've heard tell that at some scale you can't tell time, at least not from just-about the concist representation of it at sqrt(h G \ 2 pi c^5). What if 2 pi wants to be with c . I demonstrated in my dissertation that imagination creates legalities, which is a nice arranged assemblage on order. 

Regardless, either any notion of space 'below' this scale, missing quantities of requisite units - or composed with and with a less smooth evaluation - is continuous, in that influence may always proceed, unless halted by condensed matter. Otherwise discrete, which begs the question: how does the message get across the gap? Perhaps the gap flexes (quasi)-piezoelectrically, perhaps we entangle the two 'plates' that make the gap. Persistently? 

And, can there be a computation on any signal that traverses, such that it may find a black hole before it happens.

I say no further explanation than what a curiousity may tell, that perhaps an explanation is needed for the quantization of space.

A space to at least think before time. A now-having-started starting repo. 

Does an algorithm exist below the Planck time? Survey says maybe! A gift from BHs. 

Can a framed operator algebra on a limited runtime compute molecules? Evidently perhaps. 

If you've got a proof with neutrinos, I'm all ears. 

Before we question spacetime, capitalization added, is the original manuscript. Some things are wrong as I'm trying to presently prove. The star is a fill-in for a mode of operation, which is stated as uncertainty while time. Want to help me (re-)design *tacparcel*?
